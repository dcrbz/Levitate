#Pull-Requests
You did awesome things in Levitate? - Send me your pull request. Please always send your pull-request to the lastest version-branch. Branch **v1.5.4** for example. 
I have to reject your pull-requests in other branches than the lastest version. :cold_sweat:

#How can I help you?
Maybe you have a good idea for Levitate. Create an issue or fork Levitate and implement it by yourself. 
You could also help me, working through the existing issues. Issues labeled with `Help wanted` are primary things I don't want to do :cold_sweat: Maybe you want to solve them.
Issues labeled with `In progress` are issues I'm already working on. May post a comment in the issue that you are working on the issue, so we don't do the work twice.
